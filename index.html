        Planning: 
            I need a form element.  The form needs to collect Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password confirmation.  

            Each field should have errors when not properly filled out:
                - Email: Required, Needs the right Pattern of (xxx@xxx.com)
                - Country: Required
                - Zip Code: Required, Pattern (12345), Minimum 5
                - Password: Required, Minimum 7 Chars, Max 20 Chars
                - Password Confirmation: Same as Password, must === password

            For any error:
                - The field needs a red border CSS class
                - There needs to be an error message specific to what exactly is missing from the form element

            Form Submit: 
                - Cannot submit with any errors
                - Upon submission, triggers errors classes to be attached? (maybe just always be happening)
                - event.preventDefault() if the form isn't properly filled out
                - Alert('Submitted!') if the form IS filled out
